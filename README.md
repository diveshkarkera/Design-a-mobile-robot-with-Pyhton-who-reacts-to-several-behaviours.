# Design-a-mobile-robot-with-Pyhton-who-reacts-to-several-behaviours.
Robots are machines that are built to assist in easing human effort. A robot with an Artificial Intelligence is a computerized machine that can execute an explicit task with no human mediation or involvement, providing accuracy and speed. For this project, we will be using mobile robots which are built with industry-level chipsets and sensors. In this report, we explain that a single software framework can be used to represent several reactive behaviours and high-level behaviour. We will demonstrate a few Braitenberg behaviours such as love, aggression, fear, and curiosity which would be considered as low-level behaviour. The high-level behaviour indicates that the robot follows an individual and maintains a safe distance, keeping away from collisions with individuals and different objects
